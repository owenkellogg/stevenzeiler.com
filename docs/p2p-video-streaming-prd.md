# Product Requirements Document: Peer-to-Peer Video Streaming for Yoga Classes

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** May 16, 2025  
**Author:** Product Team  

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for implementing real-time peer-to-peer (P2P) video streaming functionality into our yoga class platform. The feature will enable instructors and participants to connect directly with each other during scheduled yoga sessions, creating a more interactive and personalized experience compared to the current audio-only class format.

## 2. Background and Strategic Alignment

Our platform currently offers scheduled yoga classes with audio guidance, which has been successful but lacks the visual interaction that many users desire. By adding P2P video capabilities, we can:

- Create a more engaging and personalized experience
- Enable instructors to provide real-time form correction
- Foster a sense of community among participants
- Differentiate our platform from competitors offering audio-only experiences
- Increase user retention and engagement metrics

## 3. User Problems and Opportunities

### Problems Solved

- **Limited Feedback:** Currently, students cannot receive visual feedback on their form
- **Isolation:** Users practice alone without seeing others, reducing motivation and community feeling
- **Instructor Connection:** Instructors cannot visually demonstrate techniques in real-time
- **Verification:** No way to verify participants are actually practicing

### Opportunities

- Create premium tiers for 1-on-1 video sessions
- Enable group classes with multiple participants

   - Create HLS/DASH streaming formats for adaptive playback
   - Optional: Generate audio-only version for bandwidth-constrained playback

2. **Storage Optimization**
   - Implement retention policies (auto-delete after X days for free tier)
   - Storage quota management per user/account level
   - Compression optimization for yoga content
   - Cold storage option for older recordings

3. **Playback Experience**
   - Custom video player with yoga-specific controls

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Chunked uploads (5-10MB segments)
   - Progressive loading for immediate playback
   - Background processing to avoid UI blocking
   - Caching strategy for frequently accessed recordings

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Connection loss during recording/upload
   - Storage quota exceeded scenarios
   - Handling of very long sessions
   - Cross-device access to recordings

## 8. Dependencies and Risks

| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Extensive testing across platforms, graceful degradation |
| Privacy concerns from users | High | Low | Clear consent process, privacy controls, transparent data usage |
| Scaling issues with many concurrent sessions | High | Low | Phased rollout, load testing, monitoring |
| Increased server costs | Medium | High | Implement P2P to minimize server relay, usage caps for free tier |

## 9. Open Questions

- Should we build our own WebRTC implementation or use a service like Twilio or Agora?
- What are the bandwidth requirements for users and how will this affect accessibility?
- Should we prioritize higher quality or lower latency for yoga instruction?
- What is the optimal UI layout for different devices (phone vs. tablet vs. desktop)?
- What are the storage quota limits we should implement for recordings?
- Should we offer transcoding options for different playback quality levels?

## 10. Success Criteria

4. Session completion rates increase by >10% compared to audio-only
5. The feature can be fully implemented within budget and timeline
6. Recording functionality is used in >30% of sessions with >90% completion rate

## 11. Future Considerations

- AI-powered form correction
- Virtual yoga studio environments

# AI Yoga Instructor: Phase 1 Implementation Plan

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** May 16, 2025  
**Author:** Engineering Team  
**Status:** Planning  
**Timeline:** 6 Weeks  

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for Phase 1 (MVP) of the AI Yoga Instructor feature. The primary goal of Phase 1 is to deliver a functional AI Instructor that can accurately deliver the Bikram 90-minute yoga series script with perfect timing and provide basic voice customization options.

## 2. Scope & Deliverables

### 2.1 In Scope

- Integration with a high-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) API
- Structured implementation of the Bikram 90-minute yoga script with precise timing
- 3 voice options (1 male, 1 female, 1 neutral)
- Basic playback controls (play, pause, resume, skip)
- Integration with the existing class scheduling system
- Backend infrastructure for script and audio processing
- Basic analytics to track usage and performance

### 2.2 Out of Scope (Future Phases)

- Additional yoga sequences beyond Bikram 90-minute
- Advanced voice customization
- Background music mixing
- Offline capability
- Adaptive timing functionality
- Multi-language support

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Components Overview

![Architecture Diagram](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=AI+Instructor+Architecture)

The system will be composed of the following components:

1. **Script Management Service**
   - Parse and store structured yoga instruction scripts
   - Manage timing metadata for each instruction
   - Serve script segments based on class progression

2. **TTS Integration Layer**
   - Connect to third-party TTS API
   - Convert text instructions to speech
   - Cache generated audio for performance

3. **Audio Delivery Service**
   - Manage audio streaming to client
   - Handle playback control signals
   - Track timing and progression

4. **Frontend Components**
   - Voice selection interface
   - Playback controls
   - Class progress visualization
   - Settings management

### 3.2 Data Flow

1. User selects Bikram 90-minute class with AI Instructor
2. User selects voice preference
3. System loads structured script with timing markers
4. Audio segments are pre-generated or retrieved from cache
5. Audio is streamed to client with precise timing
6. User interactions (pause/resume/skip) are processed in real-time

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 TTS API Integration

**Selected API:** ElevenLabs (primary), with Google WaveNet as fallback

**Requirements:**
- Natural-sounding voices with appropriate prosody for yoga instruction
- Low latency response (<300ms)
- Support for SSML tags to control pacing and emphasis
- Proper pronunciation of yoga terminology
- Cost-effective for production use

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// TTS Service interface
interface TTSService {
  generateAudio(text: string, voiceId: string, options: TTSOptions): Promise<AudioBuffer>;
  getAvailableVoices(): Promise<Voice[]>;
  getCachedAudio(textHash: string, voiceId: string): Promise<AudioBuffer | null>;
}

// Implementation with caching
class ElevenLabsTTSService implements TTSService {
  // Implementation details...
}
```

### 4.2 Script Structure

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE yoga_scripts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  duration_minutes INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE script_segments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  script_id UUID REFERENCES yoga_scripts(id),
  segment_order INTEGER NOT NULL,
  text TEXT NOT NULL,
  timing_seconds FLOAT NOT NULL,
  duration_seconds FLOAT NOT NULL,
  pose_name VARCHAR(255),
  segment_type VARCHAR(50), -- instruction, transition, rest, etc.
  UNIQUE(script_id, segment_order)
);
```

**Bikram Script Processing:**
1. Transcribe complete Bikram script
2. Segment into discrete instructions
3. Mark timing for each segment based on standard class
4. Add metadata for pose names and segment types
5. Validate timing with experienced practitioners

### 4.3 Frontend Components

**Voice Selection:**
- Simple card interface with 3 voice options
- Audio preview capability
- Persistent user preference

**Playback Controls:**
- Prominent play/pause button
- Skip forward/back 30 seconds
- Timeline scrubber with pose markers
- Current pose display
- Time elapsed/remaining

**Implementation:**
```tsx
// Voice selection component
const VoiceSelector = ({ voices, selectedVoice, onSelect }) => {
  return (
    <div className="voice-selector">
      {voices.map(voice => (
        <VoiceCard 
          key={voice.id}
          voice={voice}
          isSelected={selectedVoice === voice.id}
          onSelect={() => onSelect(voice.id)}
          onPreview={() => playVoicePreview(voice.id)}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

// Playback controls
const PlaybackControls = ({ 
  isPlaying, 
  currentTime, 
  duration,
  currentPose,
  onPlay,
  onPause,
  onSeek,
  onSkipForward,
  onSkipBack
}) => {
  // Implementation details...
};
```

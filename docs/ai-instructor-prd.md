# Product Requirements Document: AI Yoga Instructor

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** May 16, 2025  
**Author:** Product Team  

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for implementing an AI Yoga Instructor feature into our yoga platform. The feature will leverage AI to deliver precise, script-based yoga instructions with perfect timing and consistency, while allowing users to customize the voice experience. The AI Instructor will focus solely on delivering the instruction script without the personal anecdotes or distractions that sometimes occur with human instructors.

## 2. Background and Strategic Alignment

Our platform currently offers audio recordings of yoga classes led by human instructors. While effective, these recordings have several limitations:

- Instructors sometimes add personal anecdotes that distract from the practice
- Timing inconsistencies can affect the flow of the practice
- Limited voice options to suit user preferences
- Fixed recordings cannot adjust to different practice durations

The AI Instructor will address these issues by providing:

- Consistent delivery of instructions following exact scripts
- Perfect timing that maintains the flow of the practice
- Customizable voice options to suit user preferences
- Potential for adjustable practice durations in future iterations

This feature aligns with our mission to provide accessible, high-quality yoga instruction that helps users maintain consistent practice.

## 3. User Problems and Opportunities

| User resistance to AI instruction | Medium | Medium | Position as complementary option, not replacement; highlight consistency benefits |
| Pronunciation issues with yoga terminology | Medium | High | Custom pronunciation dictionary, specialized training for yoga terms |
| Increased costs for high-quality TTS API | Medium | High | Implement caching, potentially explore offline TTS models |

## 9. Open Questions

- Should we develop custom voices specifically trained for yoga instruction?
- How can we best capture the precise timing needed for each instruction?
- Should we allow users to adjust instruction verbosity (shorter vs. longer explanations)?
- How do we handle sequence variations (e.g., 60-minute vs. 90-minute versions)?
- Should we implement voice cloning to mimic popular instructors (with permission)?

## 10. Success Criteria
